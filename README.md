Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview:

The stock market is a complex and dynamic system influenced by various factors such as economic indicators, political events, company performance, and investor sentiment. Predicting stock prices is a challenging yet valuable task that can offer strategic advantages to investors and traders. In this project, I developed a Stock Market Prediction System using Python, machine learning algorithms, and Streamlit for web-based deployment. The goal was to forecast stock price trends based on historical data and technical indicators.

Objectives:
To collect and preprocess historical stock price data.

To implement machine learning models for time series prediction.

To evaluate the performance of different models based on metrics like RMSE and R² score.

To deploy the prediction system using Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Keras/TensorFlow, yfinance

Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly

Modeling Techniques: Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Random Forest

Deployment: Streamlit (Python-based web framework)

Data Collection & Preprocessing:
I used the yfinance library to fetch historical stock price data (such as Open, Close, High, Low, and Volume) for selected companies. The time frame was customizable from the Streamlit interface.

Key preprocessing steps included:

Handling missing values and outliers

Normalizing data using MinMaxScaler for LSTM model input

Generating technical indicators (like moving averages)

Creating lag features for supervised learning

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Machine Learning Models:
Several models were implemented and evaluated:

1. Linear Regression:
A simple baseline model that attempts to find a linear relationship between past stock prices and future values.

2. Random Forest Regressor:
A tree-based ensemble model that helps in capturing non-linear patterns and reducing overfitting.

3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series data. It was used to model sequences and learn from long-term dependencies in historical prices.

Model Training Process:

For LSTM, data was reshaped into 3D format: [samples, time steps, features].

Trained using the last 60 days of data as input to predict the next day’s price.

Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

Model Evaluation:
Each model was evaluated using standard regression metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

It was observed that LSTM outperformed other models in terms of accuracy, due to its ability to remember long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data. However, it required more computational power and time for training.

Web App Deployment with Streamlit:
To make the model user-friendly and accessible, the entire prediction system was deployed using Streamlit. The web app provided the following features:

User Input: Users could select a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA), and the date range.

Visualization: Plotted stock price trends (actual vs. predicted), volume data, and moving averages.

Model Selection: Users could choose between Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM models.

Prediction Output: Displayed next-day forecasted price and relevant graphs.

The app was deployed locally and optionally shared via platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Heroku for public access.

Challenges Faced:
Data Volatility: Stock markets are influenced by unpredictable real-world events (e.g., economic reports, global crises), making prediction accuracy difficult.

Overfitting: Especially with deep learning models like LSTM, careful regularization and early stopping were needed to avoid overfitting.

Performance vs. Interpretability: While models like LSTM offered higher accuracy, they were more difficult to interpret compared to simple regression models.

Conclusion:
This project provided a hands-on opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world financial application. By integrating data preprocessing, model building, and web deployment, I built an end-to-end pipeline that predicts stock trends and makes the insights easily accessible through an intuitive interface. While stock market prediction remains inherently uncertain, this system serves as a foundation for further exploration into more complex models and real-time market analysis tools.

Future Scope:
Integration of sentiment analysis using news and Twitter data.

Real-time stock price prediction using streaming data.

Implementation of advanced deep learning models like GRU or Transformer-based architectures.

Adding buy/sell signal generation for algorithmic trading strategies.
